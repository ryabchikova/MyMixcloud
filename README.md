Application for browse and interact with your data from www.mixcloud.com
Based on Mixcloud API https://www.mixcloud.com/developers/

Why i desided to create it?
I'm music lover and a big fan of Mixcloud service. So, it became interesting to look deeper at it's internal structure and try to present my vision of the user interface.

Features are planned:
- Authorization
- Following, faworiting, reposting actions
- Search across uploads, users and tags
- Deep links for listening audio in oficial Mixcloud application, because the audio streams are not available through the Mixcloud API.
- May be some interesting graphics presentation of user's statistics data
