## Intro
Application for browsing and interacting with your data from www.mixcloud.com  
Based on [Mixcloud API](https://www.mixcloud.com/developers/)

## Why did I decide to create it?
I'm music lover and a big fan of Mixcloud service. So, it became interesting to look deeper at it's internal structure and try to present my vision of the user interface.  
My mixcloud page https://www.mixcloud.com/elena-ryabchikova/

## Features are planned:
- authorization
- following, faworiting, reposting actions
- search across uploads, users and tags
- deep links for listening audio in oficial Mixcloud application, because the audio streams are not available through the Mixcloud API
- several color themes
- may be some interesting graphics presentation of user's statistics data
